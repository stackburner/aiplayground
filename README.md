# Welcome

This is the aiplayground for a sentiment classifier trained on a movie reviews dataset.

## Description

This logistic regression model for sentiment analysis uses Python's sklearn HashingVectorizer framework 
and interacts with you via Flask and Ajax on an Apache2 WSGI framework.
Most Flask setups are missing the step of deploying the application on a productive Apache2 webserver.
For that reason I am sharing my setup with you and am looking forward to receiving suggestions / answering 
questions regarding the configuration.
